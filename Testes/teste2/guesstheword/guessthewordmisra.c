/*The code provided is a simple word guessing game. However, it does not comply with many rules of MISRA C:2012. Here are some of the most notable violations, along with the corresponding rule numbers:

Rule 2.4: The function 
displayWord
 is not used in its file scope.
Rule 4.6: Function parameters 'word' and 'guessedLetters' in 
displayWord
 have no type declaration (they should be const if they're not modified).
Rules 8.4 & 8.13: The function 
displayWord
 does not have a prototype before the main function or in a header file.
Rule 12.1: There are multiple ++ or -- operators in one single line.
Rule 14.4: Using a while(1) and break statement for loop control; this could be improved by using for loop or a do-while loop with a condition that's clear and direct.
Rule 17.7: The value returned by 
printf
 is not being used.
Rule 18.6: The arrays 
secretWord
 and 
guessedLetters
 should have their size defined at compile time.
Rule 20.9 : The functions 
strchr
, 
printf
, 
scanf
, 
strlen
, and 
tolower
 from the standard library are used. MISRA forbids the use of most standard library functions.
Rule 21.3: 
stdlib.h
 is included but not used.
