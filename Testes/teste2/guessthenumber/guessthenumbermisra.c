/*Analyzing this code against the first 23 mandatory rules of MISRA C (2012), various violations can be observed. Here are some:

Rule 2.1: There are no parts of the code that have no effect.

Rule 2.2: There's no dead or inexecutable code observed.

Rule 2.3: There are no unused type declarations.

Rule 2.4: No unused tag declarations.

Rule 2.5: No unused macros.

Rule 2.6: All function parameters are used.

Rule 2.7: 
main
 doesn't require a parameter for this case, so it can remain as is.

Rule 3.1: There are no comments with 
//
.

Rule 4.1: The code uses only standard C operators.

Rule 4.2: The code doesn't contain any "trigraphs".

Rule 5.1: Identifiers are distinct and not overlapped.

Rule 5.2: All identifiers are lexically distinct.

Rule 5.3: There aren't any reused identifiers in different scopes.

Rule 5.4: There are no macro identifiers shadowing other identifiers.

Rule 5.5: No object/function identifiers are reused for macros.

Rule 5.6: Every identifier is unique within its scope.

Rule 5.7: No identifier re-declarations.

Rule 5.8: No identical identifiers in the same scope.

Rule 5.9: No violations here.

Rule 6.1: There are no bit fields.

From rule 21 onwards, there are some violations:

Rule 21.2: The 
time
 function should not be used.
Rule 21.6: The 
stdio.h
 library is not allowed in secure applications.
Rule 22.1: There's a recursion check missing.
Here is a version of your code that conforms to these rules, but it lacks the I/O operations (since stdio.h is disallowed by rule 21.6). This makes it impractical as an interactive program, but it demonstrates the MISRA C compliance:*/
#include <stdlib.h>
/* #include <time.h> Removed due to Rule 21.2 violation */

#define MAX_GUESS_NUMBER 100U

int main(void) {
    /* srand(time(0)); Removed due to Rule 21.2 violation */
    unsigned int numberToGuess = rand() % MAX_GUESS_NUMBER + 1U;
    unsigned int guess = 50U; /* Choose a fixed initial guess since scanf cannot be used */
    unsigned int attempts = 0U;

    do {
        /* printf and scanf removed due to Rule 21.6 violations */
        attempts++;

        if (guess > numberToGuess) {
            /* printf("Too high! Try again.\n"); removed due to Rule 21.6 violation */
            guess--;
        } else if (guess < numberToGuess) {
            /* printf("Too low! Try again.\n"); removed due to Rule 21.6 violation */
            guess++;
        } else {
            /* printf("Congratulations! You guessed the number in %d attempts.\n", attempts); 
               Removed due to Rule 21.6 violation */ 
        }
    } while (guess != numberToGuess);

    return 0;
}

/*This limits the functionality of the program significantly but it addresses the noted rule violations. For practical use, you'll need to find alternatives to the disallowed functions for user input/output and random number generation. This could be specific to your application environment and may involve using low-level OS-specific APIs or a specially designed safety-critical library.*/
